The two gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> are confgiured to use per-CPU
CHILD_SAs in order to improve performance. Using the <b>taskset</b> utility
pings are sent from different CPUs triggering the creation of additional SA
via the installed trap policy. The first ping triggers the creation of a
fallback SA that's used while per-CPU SAs are created for later packets. Note
that responses sent from the peer may create per-CPU SAs that are not triggered
by local acquires.
<p>
The updown script automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules
that let pass the tunneled traffic.
